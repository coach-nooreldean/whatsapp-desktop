It loads `web.whatsapp.com`, so it is the same client WhatsApp serves to a
browser — no reverse-engineered protocol, and nothing that puts an account at
risk.

It is the second attempt. The first, [`whatsapp`](https://github.com/abdallah-shehawey/whatsapp),
is 120 KB of C against GTK4 and WebKitGTK; this one starts from an engine that
does not need most of its workarounds. They install side by side and share
nothing, not even a state directory.

**[abdallah-shehawey.github.io/whatsapp-desktop](https://abdallah-shehawey.github.io/whatsapp-desktop/)**
— every install command spelled out, and the newest packages read straight off
the latest release.

## What it does

- **Lives in the tray.** Closing the window keeps the client connected;
  `Ctrl+Q` and the tray's Quit are the two ways out, and it can start hidden at
  login. GNOME has no tray of its own: the icon needs the AppIndicator
  extension, and the client waits for it rather than giving up when it starts
  first at login.
- **A font for English and a font for Arabic** — family, size, bold and italic
  for each, chosen from what is installed, each with its own "use the system
  font" switch, in a window of their own on the tray's *Fonts…*. It costs
  nothing per element: the two scripts are two `@font-face` faces of one
  family, split by `unicode-range`, so there is no rule matching every element
  on a scrolling page.
- **Draws everything in the desktop's font**, applied live when you change it,
  down to the client's own windows.
- **One notification per message**, with the sender, the text and the sender's
  picture, a click that opens that conversation, and a withdrawal the moment you
  open the chat or read it on your phone. Each message is its own entry rather
  than a replacement for the last, media says what kind it is (`📷 Photo`,
  `🏷 Sticker`, `🎤 Voice message`) so it cannot be mistaken for somebody typing
  the word, and every line of a banner reads the way its own words do rather
  than taking its direction from the Latin name in front of it. Nothing is announced for a message you sent
  yourself, a muted group is silent unless you were mentioned in it, and
  do-not-disturb silences the tone as well as the banner.
- **Arabic reads like Arabic.** Every line of a message takes its direction
  from its own first strong character, so Arabic sits against the right margin
  and English against the left in the same message — whichever of them the
  message happens to open with, and whatever emoji or punctuation comes first.
  In a bubble and in the replies to a community post alike; the panel behind
  “6 replies” is built nothing like a bubble and had to be taught separately.
  Descenders get the room WhatsApp's line boxes do not leave them, and the
  timestamp is kept off the last line of the text instead of landing on top of
  it. The chat list is the exception, on purpose: it is a column of rows rather
  than words to be read, so an Arabic name sits exactly where an English one
  does and only the letters inside it run the other way. None of this is a
  switch: it is how the client draws a conversation.
- **Banners come down on the client's own clock.** GNOME shows one at a time,
  queues three behind it and drops the rest, so each banner is closed after
  twelve seconds and refiled silently in the notification centre.
- **Voice and video calls, with nothing to allow first.** The camera and the
  microphone are granted to WhatsApp's own origin and to no other, so a call
  rings or is answered without a permission prompt in the way. Each one opens in
  a window of its own, drawn in this client's font like every other page it
  shows. WebGPU is turned off deliberately: on Linux and Wayland its external
  texture path hands video frames back black, and a call camera that renders a
  black 1280×720 rectangle is what that looks like.
- **Multiple WhatsApp accounts side by side.** Run secondary accounts in
  isolated partitions (`persist:account_<id>`) alongside your primary account
  without session interference. Switch instantly with `Ctrl+1` through
  `Ctrl+9` or via the vertical sidebar. Each account maintains its own unread
  counts, notifications carry the account name prefix when multiple accounts
  exist, clicking an account's notification switches directly to that account
  and chat, and the tray icon and launcher badge reflect aggregate unread
  messages across all accounts. The sidebar can be collapsed with
  `Ctrl+Alt+S` or opened to add accounts with `Ctrl+Alt+A`.
- **Windows of switches, and no text editor.** Settings (`Ctrl+,`, or the
  tray) has the theme — system, dark or light — start-at-login, what closing
  the window does, multi-account management, which sounds you want and the
  zoom; *Fonts…* has the two scripts; *About WhatsApp* shows versions and
  updates; and a dedicated *Add Account* window (`Ctrl+Alt+A`) lets you add
  new accounts with customized names and palette colors. The tray menu
  itself is five items (Open/Minimize, Settings, Fonts, About, and Quit)
  and stays that way.
- **Says when a new version is out.** *About WhatsApp* in the tray menu has the
  version running, a check against the latest release and a link to the site;
  the client also looks once a day by itself, and the tray item names the
  version when there is one to name. It never installs anything — your package
  manager does that, and the site has the command for your distribution.
- **It moves better than the browser it is.** Four things, all measured rather
  than guessed. The conversation scrolls on the GPU: Chromium's Linux driver
  blocklist is years out of date and decides against compositing on hardware
  that is fine, which turns every wheel tick into a software raster of the whole
  viewport — that is overridden, the messages list is put on a layer of its own,
  and a wheel notch is animated instead of jumped. The right-hand drawer slides
  in and out rather than appearing. And the reply bar and the conversation above
  it now rise as one: WhatsApp animates the bar from JavaScript every frame
  while the messages follow a watcher two frames behind, so the bar grew for
  73ms and the messages then jumped 66px in a single frame — both halves are
  taken over and released together, and the last row now travels that 66px in 21
  to 23 steps. And a message landing in the conversation on screen no longer
  arrives by teleport: WhatsApp appends the row and scrolls by exactly its
  height in the same frame, so the whole conversation used to step up 55px at
  once — it now glides that distance while the new bubble grows out of its own
  bottom corner, the corner measured from the box so an Arabic conversation pops
  from the other side. And jumping to a message — the pinned one at the top of a
  chat, a quoted reply, a search result — now ends on the message rather than a
  screenful past it. WhatsApp scrolls twice: once instantly, to bring the message
  onto the screen, and then a 400ms settle that centres it. The settle works out
  where it is going the moment it starts, while the rows above the message are
  still being rendered, so it scrolls faithfully to a measurement of a
  conversation that no longer exists: the message went from 35px below the top of
  the room to 1304px above it. It is run again here instead, on WhatsApp's own
  curve and to WhatsApp's own destination, but against a measurement taken every
  frame — so the second and third pinned messages of a chat land as squarely as
  the first. None of it is a setting: it is how the client draws a page.
  There are deliberately **no** custom scrollbars — one `::-webkit-scrollbar`
  rule takes a scroller off Chromium's composited path and puts it back on the
  main thread, and that is a cosmetic gain paid for in frames.
- **A right-click menu where the page has none.** WhatsApp answers a right-click
  over a message with its own menu, and this stays out of its way; everywhere it
  does not — the composer, the search boxes, a page a link opened in a window of
  its own — there is now a native one, with the spell checker's suggestions at
  the top of it. Copy, paste and paste-without-formatting, a link's address, an
  image, and *Inspect* for the devtools that are already a `Ctrl+Shift+I` away.
- **Screen sharing in a call**, over PipeWire on Wayland, offering windows as
  well as whole screens.
- Dark or light follows the desktop, links open in your browser, every download
  asks where to put it, `Ctrl` `+`/`-`/`0` zoom and the window size is
  remembered. `Esc` closes the emoji panel whether or not you picked one.

## What it looks like

Three windows of its own, and no text editor anywhere. Widths differ so the
heights match; every one of them is a real window, photographed by
`make screenshots`.

</p>

## Install

From the [shinux repository](https://abdallah-shehawey.github.io/shinux-repo/):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://abdallah-shehawey.github.io/shinux-repo/install.sh | sudo sh
sudo dnf install whatsapp-desktop     # Fedora and friends
sudo apt install whatsapp-desktop     # Debian, Ubuntu 24.04+
sudo pacman -S whatsapp-desktop       # Arch
```

Packages are also on every [release](../../releases), and the
[website](https://abdallah-shehawey.github.io/whatsapp-desktop/#download) links
whichever one is newest. It ships its own copy of Electron, so it needs no
browser installed — 245 MB on disk, 76 MB as a `.deb`.

The package installs a system-wide autostart entry, so the client starts hidden
in the tray at login. To stop that: Settings → Applications → Startup, or delete
`/etc/xdg/autostart/io.github.shehawey.whatsapp-desktop.desktop`.

## Build

Needs Node and nothing else.

```sh
make            # fetches Electron
make install    # ~/.local, plus a desktop entry and icons
make autostart  # also start hidden at login
make test       # replays a chat list past the watcher, no browser needed
make screenshots # re-photographs the three windows, for the README and the site
```

## Keys

| | |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl` `+` / `-` / `0` | zoom in, out, reset |
| `Ctrl+,` | open Settings window |
| `Ctrl+1` – `Ctrl+9` | switch to account 1 through 9 |
| `Ctrl+Alt+A` | open Add Account window |
| `Ctrl+Alt+S` | toggle accounts sidebar (collapse / expand) |
| `Ctrl+R` | reload active conversation view |
| `Ctrl+W` | close window (hides to tray) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+I` | devtools |
| `Ctrl+Q` | quit for real |
| window close | hides to the tray, stays connected |

## Configuration

`~/.config/whatsapp-desktop/whatsapp-desktop.conf`, every key optional:

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `[view] theme` | `system` | `system` follows the desktop, or force `dark` / `light` |
| `[view] font` | the GNOME interface font | family for everything the client draws |
| `[view] font-size` | `16` | root font size in pixels — WhatsApp sizes in rem |
| `[view] zoom` | `1.0` | also set with `Ctrl` `+`/`-` |
| `[view] force-font` | `true` | draw the page in one family |
| `[view] sidebar-collapsed` | `false` | whether the multi-account sidebar switcher starts collapsed |
| `[fonts] latin-inherit` | `true` | Latin follows the desktop font; off to choose one |
| `[fonts] latin-family` | the desktop font | family for Latin letters, digits and punctuation |
| `[fonts] latin-size` | `100` | its size, as a percentage of the family's own |
| `[fonts] latin-bold`, `latin-italic` | `false` | draw Latin in the family's bold or italic **face** — nothing is synthesised, so a family without one cannot be made to have it |
| `[fonts] arabic-inherit` | `true` | the same switch for Arabic, separately |
| `[fonts] arabic-family` | whatever the system draws Arabic in | family for Arabic, even in the middle of an English line |
| `[fonts] arabic-size` | `100` | Arabic on its own, beside the Latin in the same line |
| `[fonts] arabic-bold`, `arabic-italic` | `false` | as above |
| `[window] width`, `height` | `1200x800` | remembered on exit |
| `[behaviour] close-to-tray` | `true` | closing the window leaves the client running |
| `[behaviour] minimize-to-tray` | `false` | minimise is not close |
| `[behaviour] spellcheck` | `true` | Chromium's own, in the box you type in |
| `[behaviour] raise` | `auto` | how the window is brought to the front when a banner is clicked. `auto` picks one and corrects itself once from what the window actually did; `activate` (ask the compositor) and `remap` (take it down and open it again) are taken as given |
| `[notifications] enabled` | `true` | off hands notifications back to Chromium |
| `[notifications] sound` | `true` | a tone for the banners this client raises |
| `[notifications] outgoing-sound` | `false` | WhatsApp's own tone for a message *you* send |
| `[notifications] whatsapp-sound` | `false` | let WhatsApp play its own tone for a message arriving, instead of the desktop tone this client plays either way |
| `[notifications] banner-seconds` | `12` | before a banner is refiled silently |
| `[notifications] hide-preview` | `false` | on, a banner names the chat and the kind of message and never the words |
| `[media] ask-where-to-save` | `true` | every download asks; off, they land in `~/Downloads` |
| `[media] download-dir` | — | where the last one went, so the chooser opens there; written by the client |
| `[media] download-stickers` | `true` | fetch stickers whether or not photos are — the phone has no sticker switch either |
| `[media] hide-controls-when-paused` | `true` | take the desktop's media card down when a voice note is paused, rather than when it ends |
| `[links] claim-scheme` | `true` | open `whatsapp:` links here rather than in a browser tab |
| `[updates] check` | `true` | the daily look for a newer release; off, nothing asks by itself and *Check* in About still does |

Configuration lives in `~/.config/whatsapp-desktop/whatsapp-desktop.conf`.
Account metadata lives in `~/.config/whatsapp-desktop/accounts.json`.
Primary session and application state live in `~/.local/share/whatsapp-desktop`, while secondary accounts use isolated partitions under Chromium partition storage (`persist:account_<id>`).

## Layout

| | |

| `src/page/inject.js`, `src/page/avatar.js`, `src/page/media.js`, `src/page/pictures.js`, `src/page/store.js` | in-page injection scripts |
| `tools/make-icons.py` | regenerates `data/icons` — `make icons`, never hand-edit the PNGs |
| `tools/make-og.py` | redraws the site's link-preview card — `make og` |
| `tools/capture-windows.js` | photographs the three windows above — `make screenshots`, which also copies them to `docs/assets` |
| `docs/` | the landing page, served by GitHub Pages from `main` |
| `tools/test-*.js` | `make test` test runners (inject, bidi, wording, style, fonts, settings, links, tray, update, accounts, config) |

## Notifications, when they do not appear

A notification carries the id of a `.desktop` file and GNOME reads its name and
icon from there, so running from a source tree with nothing installed gives a
banner titled `io.github.shehawey.whatsapp-desktop` with a blank icon.
`make install` is the fix, not a code change.

If a banner reaches the notification centre but never floats, check that a plain
`notify-send hello world` floats. If that does not either, it is the desktop —
GNOME suppresses banners while a window is fullscreen, while presence is BUSY,
and while `show-banners` is off.

## Diagnosing it

```sh
WHATSAPP_DEBUG_EVAL=/tmp/eval.js whatsapp-desktop
```

Whatever lands in that file is evaluated in the live page. Some words are
commands to the app instead: `#snapshot`, `#hide`, `#show`, `#state`, `#gpu`,
`#tone`, `#about`, `#settings`, `#fonts`, and `#scroll <selector>` — sixty real
wheel events with the page's long tasks sampled around them. Give `#scroll` the
selector; left to pick a scroller itself it can measure one element while the
wheel turns over another. `#snapshot about`, `#snapshot settings` and
`#snapshot fonts` photograph the client's own windows rather than the page, and
`#update 1.0.0` asks GitHub as though this were an older release, which is the
only way to see what a client with a version waiting for it looks like —
`#update off` puts the real one back.

Unset by default — it is a way into a live WhatsApp session, not a feature.
