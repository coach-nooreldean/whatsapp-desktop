# second line is the other half -- the electron binary genuinely does require
# those SONAMEs, and once they stop being provided the package cannot install

# The session bus itself, not the library: the tray does not link libdbus at all.
# It writes the protocol onto the socket in $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS (see
# src/dbus.js), because owning the menu is the only way to keep its item ids
# still, and a client that borrows a menu cannot. Without a bus running there is
# no tray at all -- so the daemon is named here, where dbus-libs below only ever
# covered Chromium's own linkage.
Requires:       dbus
Requires:       dbus-libs
# gdbus, which is how the Electron tray -- the fallback, for a session this
# client cannot reach the bus of -- asks whether a status icon host is listening.
# gtk3 already pulls it in; it is named here because the tray, not the toolkit,
# is what stops working without it.

WhatsApp Web in a dedicated Chromium window with a system tray, desktop
notifications, desktop font integration, and Arabic text fixes.

%build
# Electron is downloaded and installed by the packaging helper before rpmbuild.
:

%install
# One source of truth for what "installed" means: the Makefile. It renames the
# Electron binary (the name becomes the Wayland app_id, and so the icon and the
# name in the switcher), drops the 53 Chromium translations of a user interface
# this app never shows, and writes the launcher -- which has to export
# FONTCONFIG_FILE, because fontconfig is read before any of the app's own code
# runs and that is how the desktop font is imposed without a stylesheet.
make install DESTDIR=%{buildroot} PREFIX=/usr

# Autostart is shipped system-wide rather than written into a home directory, so
# the package can cleanly remove it again. It starts hidden, in the tray.

# The icon theme keeps a compiled cache, and a launcher icon replaced under a
# directory that already has one goes on being drawn from the cache until it is
# rebuilt. That is the whole of "I updated and the icon did not change" -- so it
# is rebuilt here, on install and on update alike, and again after a removal so
# the entry does not linger. The tray icon is not affected either way: the app
# loads that one straight off disk by path, never through the theme.
