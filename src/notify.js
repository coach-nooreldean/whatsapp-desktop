/*
 * Banners.
 *
 * Two things here are not Electron's defaults, and both were learned the hard
 * way on GNOME with the GTK client.
 *
 * A banner is taken down on the client's clock. GNOME reads the expire_timeout
 * of a notification and throws it away: a banner leaves the screen when the user
 * has been active *and* the pointer is not resting on it. The shell shows one at
 * a time, queues three behind it and drops the rest -- so a single banner parked
 * under an idle mouse pointer silently swallows every message that follows.
 * Measured live: with one stuck, six notifications produced no banner and no
 * sound between them, including one sent at critical urgency, and the moment it
 * went away the next one rang. Each banner is closed after twelve seconds and
 * the message posted again at LOW urgency, which the shell files in the
 * notification centre without a banner and without a sound. Nothing is lost and
 * nothing blocks.
 *
 * And a picture is stored under a name taken from the picture itself. A
 * notification holds the PATH of its icon and the shell reads it lazily, so a
 * rotating name meant a later message could rewrite the file under a banner
 * still on screen and put one sender's face on another sender's message.
