/*
 * Page-side helpers, running in WhatsApp Web's own world from document-start.
 *
 * Almost all of this is the notification story, and it is carried over from the
 * GTK client where every line of it was paid for on a live session. What is NOT
 * here is just as deliberate:
 *
 *   - No clipboard shim. WebKitGTK handed the page an empty clipboardData for
 *     images, so Ctrl+V pasted nothing and the bytes had to be lifted off the
 *     GTK clipboard and dispatched by hand. Chromium's clipboard is not broken.
 *
 *   - No document.hasFocus override. WebKit reported a view in a hidden window
 *     as focused, and the truth had to be pushed in from the app; get that wrong
 *     in either direction and it costs either every notification or every read
 *     receipt. Chromium reports it correctly, so the page is left alone and only
 *     this file's own idea of focus is pushed in, for the watcher.
 *
 *   - No emoji sprite cache. Nothing on this machine kept WhatsApp's 152 sprite
 *     sheets between runs -- WebKit's disk cache stored not one of them -- so
 *     every launch pulled 4.7 MB again and the emoji panel sat full of blank
 *     squares. Chromium's HTTP cache keeps them.

   * the window is in front, had nothing of the kind: clicking one raised the

   * the top of it -- which is the part that is rendered.

   * is not on the row: it is on an element inside it, and an event dispatched at

   * every handler between it and the row.

   * was on and then showed no dialog at all -- "it was impossible to join the
   * group without WhatsApp Web". Every other WhatsApp client on Linux puts the
   * invite up without reloading anything.
   *
   * Measured on the live page, and this is the whole of it: the dialog is
   * `WAWebGroupInviteLinkModal.react`, its props are `{ groupCode, source }` and
   * nothing else, and it is NOT in the bundle this client boots with -- going to
   * /accept adds exactly one module to a registry of 17964, and that is the one.
   * `WAWebGroupInviteLinkModalLoadable.react` is what fetches it: that one IS in
   * the bundle, it is an ordinary React component, and rendering it pulls the
   * chunk down. So the dialog goes up through WhatsApp's own ModalManager --
   * verified with the chat list still behind it and the URL still at
   * web.whatsapp.com: group photo, name, when it was created, who is already in
   * it, Cancel and Join group. Nothing is joined without that button.
   *
   * A code the server will not have answers in the same dialog and in WhatsApp's
   * own words ("Couldn't join this group. Please try again later."), which is
   * the other reason to let WhatsApp draw this rather than draw one here.
   *
   * The wait and the fallback are openByNumber's, for openByNumber's two
   * reasons: a link that started this client arrives while the registry is still
   * being built, and on the morning these names change the reload still works.
   *
   * The wait is for the chat list as well as for the modules, and that is a
   * measured requirement rather than caution. A link that STARTS this client
   * resolves those modules about six seconds before WhatsApp has drawn anything:
   * asked then, ModalManager takes the call, answers nothing, and does not even
   * fetch the modal's chunk -- sampled every 200ms through a cold start, the
   * dialog was never on the page for a single frame. #pane-side is the app being

  /*
   * Escape closes the emoji panel, whether or not an emoji has been picked.
   *
   * Every line of this was measured against the live page, and each measurement
   * killed a fix that had looked obvious:
   *
   *   The button carries no aria-expanded -- the attribute is absent, open or
   *   shut -- so there is nothing to ask whether the panel is up. What is up is
   *   read off the panel instead: it is the page's only [role="application"].
   *
   *   It carries no data-icon either. Every icon on this build is an <svg> whose
   *   only marking is a <title> child, so the button is found by its label and
   *   by that title, never by data-icon.
   *
   *   Picking an emoji moves focus to an <input> inside the panel, the "Search
   *   emoji" box. That is the bug entire: WhatsApp's Escape handler is on the
   *   composer, and a key typed into a box that is not the composer never
   *   reaches it. Which is the report exactly -- it closes if you have not
   *   picked one, and does not if you have.
   *
   *   Escape does not close it however it is delivered: dispatched at the panel,
   *   at the search box, or sent into the window as a real key by the app. Nor
   *   does a click outside. The one thing that closes it is the button, pressed
   *   the way the row of a chat has to be pressed -- at the deepest node inside
   *   it, because the handler is not on the button but on an element under it,
   *   and an event dispatched at the button travels upwards and never reaches it.
   *
   * The trusted-key route was tried and is gone. It also taught something worth
   * keeping written down: a key the app injects arrives back here as an ordinary
   * keydown, this handler caught it, asked for another, and the two processes
   * threw Escapes at each other until the renderer stopped answering at all.

   * and there are twenty-odd keydown listeners on window that look like one per
   * mounted panel. It does NOT close a conversation inside a community, and the
   * live page finally said why. Three listeners of this file's own, one at each
   * point of the dispatch, watched a real key sent by the app:
   *
   *   an ordinary chat -- the key arrives at window's capture phase unprevented,
   *   travels the whole way to the bubble phase, and the conversation is already
   *   gone by the time it gets there. Nothing consumed it; something acted on it.
   *
   *   a community subgroup -- by window's capture phase defaultPrevented is
   *   ALREADY true, and the key never reaches the bubble phase at all. Something
   *   the community view mounts answers Escape, calls preventDefault and
   *   stopPropagation, and then closes nothing. The conversation stays up.
   *
   * So there was never anything to retry: the key was not missed, it was eaten.
   * Sending a second one -- at the document, with the caret out of the composer,
   * which is what stood here before -- only fed the same handler again, and was
   * measured doing nothing both times. What closes it is WhatsApp's own
   * closeActiveChat, and failing that its menu's own "Close chat", pressed the
   * way every control on this page has to be.
   *
   * The one thing this must never do is close a conversation for an Escape that
   * was for something else -- a dropdown, the profile drawer, in-chat search, a
   * reply being cancelled. Every one of those leaves the conversation open too,
   * so "still open" is not the test. What they are told apart by is timing, and
   * the timings were measured one at a time:
   *
   *   a dropdown is the slow one. It stays in the DOM for its exit animation --
   *   141ms and 147ms in two runs -- and a MutationObserver over the whole of
   *   #app saw NOTHING before that, not an attribute, not a class. Nothing can
   *   tell it apart from an Escape that did nothing, so waiting for it would put
   *   a seventh of a second in front of every close. It does not have to be
   *   waited for: a dropdown that is up is up at the keypress, and reading it
   *   there costs nothing.
   *
   *   everything else goes at once. The profile drawer was gone 27ms after the
   *   key. In-chat search closed inside the dispatch itself -- a listener
   *   registered after this one, on the same event, already saw it gone.
   *
   * So: a layer that is up at the keypress is answered by leaving Escape alone,
   * and everything else is caught by watching the page for a short moment. The
   * page is counted rather than reasoned about, because a count moves for a
   * layer this code has never heard of too. Measured at rest that count sat at
   * 3611 without a flicker, and a message landing inside the window costs
   * nothing worse than an Escape that has to be pressed a second time. */

   *
   * The second is the one it plays for a message arriving while the window is

   * same message sounded like two different events depending on where the
   * window happened to be. It is silenced here and the client plays its tone
   * for that banner too, which is the whole of "one event, one sound".
   *
   * Neither can be silenced by name. WhatsApp serves its sounds from
   * static.whatsapp.net under filenames that are hashes -- l-ut9G1w4eu.ogg,
   * kAbvQpjkfMK.ogg -- and they change with the build, so there is nothing
   * stable to match on. What is stable is the moment: a message goes out because
   * the user pressed a key or clicked a button, and the tone follows within a

   * CanPlay true; paused and recycled -> CanPlay false, PlaybackStatus
   * "Stopped", currentTime still 2.52, readyState still 4, the bubble still
   * reading its duration and offering Play; pressed again -> resumed from 2.52

   *
   * Audio only, deliberately. A <video> stripped of its resource has nothing to

   * of WhatsApp, and they do not keep step. Sampled every frame on the live
   * page, in a one-to-one and in a group alike:
   *
   *   opening -- the bar grows from nothing to its full 67px between 83ms and
   *   156ms, and the conversation behind it does not move at all until 168ms,
   *   when the messages jump 66px in a single frame. The bar arrives, and the
   *   chat snaps up after it.
   *
   *   closing -- the bar is sprung down from 200px and its content is 67px
   *   tall, so for 225ms nothing happens at all; then it collapses over 66ms
   *   and the conversation comes back in two jumps, 36px and 31px.
   *
   * The bar's own height is Velocity's -- it writes `max-height` and
   * `transform: translateY()` inline on [data-testid="popup_panel"] every frame
   * -- and the conversation's is a watcher of WhatsApp's that answers a couple
   * of frames later. Neither can be hurried from out here, so both are taken
   * over.
   *
   * What replaces them is ONE motion given to two elements. The panel is pinned
   * at the height it needs, which the footer takes in a single layout; the
   * quoted message inside it is parked a bar-height below, out of sight under
   * the `overflow-y: hidden` the panel already carries; and in the very frame
   * the conversation shrinks, the messages are pushed back down by exactly the
   * room that was taken and both are let go together. The bar rises into place
   * while the messages rise with it, to the frame, and nothing but a transform
   * moves.
   *
   * An eased `max-height` of our own shipped first and was not enough, which is
   * worth writing down. The layout it costs is genuinely small -- 0.17ms a
   * frame, median of fourteen forced layouts of a 28-row conversation, worst
   * 0.61ms -- and the main thread stays free through the whole open (511,000
   * zero-timeout callbacks in 450ms, worst gap 9ms, no long tasks at all). None
   * of that is where a height animation costs. What it does every frame is make
   * the footer AND the conversation above it paint again: the bar grows, the
   * messages move up behind it, and all of it is re-rastered eleven times over.
   * A transform is none of that.
   *
   * The mount is an event rather than a search. A one-millisecond animation in
   * the user stylesheet raises `animationstart` on every mount (src/style.js),
   * and this panel is unmounted every time the bar is dismissed -- the drawer's
   * case turned round -- so it arrives every time, in every chat, group and

   * A message arriving in the conversation on screen -- sent or received --
   * measured on the live page 2026-09-04 with the rows sampled every frame.
   *
   * There is no motion in it at all. WhatsApp appends the row and, when the
   * conversation is held at its bottom, scrolls by exactly the room the row
   * took, both in the SAME frame. From a 55px message: scrollTop 2576 -> 2631,
   * scrollHeight 3363 -> 3418, the list's own top -55px, and the row that used
   * to be last stayed at viewport top 778 while everything above it stepped up
   * 55 pixels in one go. The new bubble is simply there, already at rest.
   *
   * So the whole conversation jumps a message-height every time one lands, and
   * that jump is the thing to answer. It is answered the way the reply bar's is:
   * the list is put back where the eye last saw it and glided to where WhatsApp
   * has already scrolled it, which costs a compositor transform and no layout,
   * and the arriving bubble grows into place out of its own bottom corner over
   * the same window. Nothing about scrolling changes -- a transform is not
   * layout, so scrollTop and scrollHeight are what WhatsApp set them to.
   *
   * What the DOM offers to hang this on, all checked rather than assumed on
   * this build:
   *
   *  - `message-in` / `message-out` ARE GONE. Every class on a row is
   *    obfuscated now (`x1n2onr6 xscbp6u`), and the only semantic names left
   *    anywhere inside #main are selectable-text, copyable-text, copyable-area
   *    and the html-* ones. So which side a message came from is measured from
   *    the bubble's box instead -- which is also the only reading that survives
   *    an Arabic interface, where the sides are the other way round.
   *  - The bubble is `[data-testid="msg-container"]`, and a row that has none is
   *    not a message: "Your security code changed" and the day separators are
   *    rows too, and they are centred rather than on either side.
   *  - The row is NOT the node the mutation reports. WhatsApp appends a plain
   *    wrapper two levels down from the list and the row is inside it, so the
   *    added nodes are searched downwards for one.
   *
   * What it costs, measured at 165Hz against the same send with all of this
   * turned off: WhatsApp's own frame -- inserting the row and painting it --
   * runs 10 to 12ms, and with the glide and the pop on top of it 11 to 17ms.
   * Every frame after that one is 6ms, the display's own. The `will-change`
   * hint is free on the other side too: the client's scroll probe over the same
   * conversation answers 201/216ms blocked with it and 214/240ms without.

   * Clicking the pinned message at the top of a chat -- or a quoted reply, or a
   * search result -- lands on the message and then scrolls a screenful past it.
   *
   * WhatsApp announces the jump before it makes it, on its own command bus.
   * MEASURED on the live page 2026-09-05, the row sampled every frame:
   *
   *   +0ms    open_chat             { msgContext: { key, msg, highlightMsg } }
   *   +14ms   scroll_to_focused_msg { pos: 'top', scrollIfNeeded: true }
   *   +15ms   scroll_to_focused_msg { pos: 'center', animate: true,
   *                                   duration: 400,
   *                                   easing: [0.88, 0.64, 0.13, 0.99] }
   *
   * So the jump is two scrolls, and WhatsApp says which message they are for and
   * where it wants it to end up. The first is instant, it brings the message
   * onto the screen, and it is right: it framed the row 35px below the top of
   * the room. The second is a Velocity animation meant to settle the row in the
   * middle of the room, and it is the one that is wrong. Velocity works out
   * where it is going at the moment it is CALLED, from the row's box at that
   * instant -- and at that instant React is still mounting the rows above it, so
   * the list grows underneath the animation (3509 -> 6097, 21 rows -> 45, over
   * the 200ms that followed). It then scrolls faithfully to a measurement of a
   * conversation that no longer exists: the row went from 35px below the top of
   * the room to 1304px ABOVE it, and stayed there.
   *
   * Both scrolls are WhatsApp's own. This client writes scrollTop nowhere near
   * them, and turning its stylesheet off changes none of it.
   *
   * What is done about it: the settle is called off and run again here. The row
   * is measured LIVE every frame and written to where WhatsApp asked for it --
   * centred -- on the curve and over the duration WhatsApp asked for. A
   * destination recomputed every frame cannot go stale, so the list growing
   * underneath the animation stops mattering: rows mount, the row moves, and the
   * same frame takes the movement back out. Measured after: the row glides from
   * 35px below the top of the room to 196, which is (737 - 345) / 2, and stays
   * there -- and the second pinned message of the same chat, an 180px row, to
   * 278, which is (737 - 180) / 2.
   *
   * The first version of this held the row wherever the instant scroll had left
   * it, which is why it worked on a chat's first pinned message and on no other.
   * There is no "wherever it landed" for the second one: the banner cycles
   * through the chat's pins, the message for the next click is often on screen
   * already, WhatsApp's instant scroll then correctly does nothing -- and
   * holding the room where it stands is holding it exactly where the jump was
   * asked to move it away from. That version also had to guess the row, from
   * whatever Velocity had marked as animating, and what Velocity animates is a
   * WRAPPER of up to three rows: the guess took the first of them, so the two
   * pinned messages behind it were held by the wrong message's box. Reading the
   * target from WhatsApp instead of guessing it from the page is the whole of
   * this fix.

   *   ... 1.6 seconds with nothing focused at all ...
   *
   * The button takes the focus, the button is then taken off the moment the
   * composer empties, and focus falls to <body>, which cannot be typed into.
   * WhatsApp puts it back sometimes and not others -- both were sampled inside
   * ten seconds of each other -- so this makes it always.
   *
   * Sending is not the only way in, which is what the first go at this missed:
   * it listened for the focus leaving the FOOTER, and the loudest case the
   * owner reported starts nowhere near it. Replying to a message is a click on
   * an item in the message's own menu; the menu closes, the item goes with it,
   * and the caret lands on <body> with a reply bar standing open over a
   * composer that cannot be typed into. So the trigger is any focus that falls
   * to nothing, wherever it fell from.
   *
   * Only the fall to NOTHING is answered, and that is the whole of the care
   * needed here. A caret that has gone somewhere is where it was asked to be:
   * the search box, a menu, another window. `document.activeElement` is the
   * body exactly when there is nowhere for a keystroke to land, which is the
   * one state worth mending.
