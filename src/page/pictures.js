/*
 * A chat's picture, put back when it breaks.
 *
 * The report: the photograph on a chat -- somebody's, or a group's -- sometimes
 * goes, and what is left is not WhatsApp's grey circle but nothing at all, a
 * hole where the face was. Opening that chat brings it back. It had been there
 * a minute earlier.
 *
 * All three halves of that are explained by the same two measurements.
 *
 * WhatsApp Web does not draw a chat's face with an <img> any more. Measured on
 * the live list: it is an <svg> with a mask, holding either an
 * `<image xlink:href="https://…">` for a photograph or a `<rect>` and a glyph
 * in a `<foreignObject>` for the grey circle. An <img> whose source fails gets a
 * broken-image mark from the engine; an SVG <image> whose href fails **draws
 * nothing**, silently, and leaves the mask empty. That is the hole, and it is
 * why no placeholder appears in its place: WhatsApp never asked for a
 * placeholder, it asked for a photograph and believes it got one.
 *
 * And the URL it asked for is not permanent. `ProfilePicThumb.img` is a derived,
 * MEMOISED getter over `eurl` -- measured, the value is cached on the model as
 * `__x_img` and re-read from there for ever -- which rewrites the host to
 * whichever CDN the model last used, `media-hbe1-1.cdn.whatsapp.net` on this
 * account, while `eurl` itself points at `pps.whatsapp.net`. The model carries
 * `hostRetryCount`, `lastHostUsed`, `markMms4HostFailure` and
 * `markMms4HostSuccess`: WhatsApp has host failover for exactly this, and the
 * intended answer to a picture that will not load is to mark the host failed and
 * derive the URL again. Nothing calls it for a chat-list avatar, because React
 * renders an `<image>` and no part of WhatsApp is listening for its error.
 *
 * So this listens. It is the only thing here that is new: everything it does
 * about a failure afterwards is WhatsApp's own -- `getProfilePic` for a fresh
 * signed URL (measured: it answers with an eurl that differs from the cached
 * one, and does NOT write it to the model), `markMms4HostFailure` for the host,
 * and, when even that fails, the same circle src/page/avatar.js already draws
 * for a notification.
 *
 * Which is also why "open the chat and it comes back" was true: opening a chat
 * is one of the things that asks WhatsApp for the picture again.
