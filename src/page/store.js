/*
 * WhatsApp's own store, asked directly.
 *
 * Everything the notification half of this client used to know, it inferred
 * from the chat list: a row moved, so something arrived; a pill went away, so
 * something was read; an @ badge is on the row, so this is a mention. Each of
 * those is a guess about a picture drawn for a person, and each of them was
 * wrong in a way that showed:
 *
 *   - a mention badge stays on the row until the mention is READ, so every
 *     ordinary message that followed one into a muted group was announced as
 *     though it were addressed to the user;
 *   - the pill is redrawn on WhatsApp's clock, so "read on the phone" reached
 *     this client seconds late, behind a MutationObserver, a 2.5s grace and a
 *     3s sweep -- and never at all while the window sat in the tray, because a
 *     hidden renderer does not repaint a list nobody is looking at;
 *   - a deleted message left its banner up, because nothing in a chat list says
 *     a message that WAS there has gone.
 *
 * None of that has to be guessed. contextIsolation is off for this window, so
 * this file shares WhatsApp Web's world, and `window.require` is Meta's own
 * module registry -- `require('__debug').modulesMap` lists 16866 of them on the
 * build measured here. The collections behind the interface are ordinary
 * Backbone-shaped models with events on them, and every question this client
 * asks has an answer that WhatsApp itself is already computing:
 *
 *   MsgCollection      'add'                    a message, with its type, its
 *                                               author and its mentions
 *   ChatCollection     'change:unreadCount'     read, here or on the phone,
 *                                               measured at 16ms behind arrival
 *   ChatCollection     'change:active'          the conversation on screen
 *   MsgCollection      'change:type' -> revoked deleted for everyone
 *   MsgCollection      'change'                 a call that has stopped ringing
 *   ReactionsCollection 'add'/'change'          somebody reacted, and to what
 *
 * These are private names and they will not be private for ever, so nothing
 * here believes them: every lookup happens inside a try, every answer is
 * checked, and a store that does not resolve leaves `ready` false -- at which
 * point inject.js keeps its chat-list watcher and the client behaves exactly as
 * it did before this file existed. The DOM path is not dead code; it is the
 * fallback for the morning WhatsApp renames a module.
