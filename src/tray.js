/*
 * The tray icon.
 *
 * Electron talks StatusNotifierItem over DBus here, which on GNOME needs the
 * AppIndicator extension (appindicatorsupport@rgcjonas.gmail.com) to have a
 * host listening. The GTK client had to speak that protocol by hand over GDBus
 * -- GTK4 has no tray at all and libayatana-appindicator is packaged for
 * GTK2/GTK3 only -- and this is the one part of it Electron simply provides.
 *
 * What Electron does not provide is waiting for that host. It asks once, when
 * the Tray is constructed, and if org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher has no owner at
 * that instant there is no icon, no error and no second attempt. That is what a
 * login looks like: /etc/xdg/autostart started this client two seconds after
 * gnome-shell, before the extension had claimed the name, and the client owned
 * no StatusNotifierItem for the rest of the session -- checked on the bus, where
 * the watcher listed Telegram, which retries, and nobody else. So the name is
 * waited for here, and the icon is built once a host is listening.
 *
 * Only the first host is waited for. An icon that already exists survives the
 * host restarting: measured by toggling the extension off and on under a plain
 * Electron tray, which was still registered afterwards. Destroying the icon and
 * building a new one is what does not survive -- the fresh registration went out
 * on a connection that was gone by the time gnome-shell asked about it ("The
 * name is not activatable" in its log) and the icon never came back. So this
 * builds once and then leaves the tray alone.
 *
 * Click is not delivered on Linux: SNI hosts open the menu instead. So every
 * action lives in the menu, including the one that shows the window.

   *
   * The wording ought to follow the window, the way Telegram's does, and it was
   * built that way and measured. What came back settles it. Electron offers one
   * lever, setContextMenu, and pulling it renumbers the whole menu: read off the
   * session bus, the item was id 19 before a hide and id 28 after, every other
   * id moved with it, and the layout revision went 2 -> 3.
   *
   * gnome-shell draws its popup from the layout it cached, and that cache holds
   * the old ids as surely as it holds the old word. So the click lands on an id
   * that no longer exists: `Event(19, 'clicked')` against this client answers
   * "error occurred in Event" and the window does not move. That is the whole of
   * the bug that has been chased through three designs -- not a stale word, a
   * dead click. Open the tray, click, nothing; open it again and it works,
   * because by then the shell has re-read the layout.
   *
   * Both of Electron's other openings are shut. `menuItem.label` and
   * `menuItem.visible` are plain JS properties: measured against Electron 40,
   * assigning to either sends no signal, changes no layout and moves no
   * revision. A property update -- `ItemsPropertiesUpdated`, which the shell
   * applies to an open popup, and which is how Telegram keeps its own wording
   * right -- cannot be sent from here at all. Telegram is Qt, owns its dbusmenu,
   * keeps its ids for the life of the process and rewrites the label when the
   * shell asks with `AboutToShow`. Reaching that from here means writing the
   * StatusNotifierItem and its menu by hand over DBus, the way the GTK client
   * did, rather than using Electron's Tray.
   *
   * So: never rebuilt, therefore never renumbered, therefore the first click
   * always works. The word says both things it does, and which one happens is
   * decided from where the window last reported itself -- see act(). Left click
   * on the icon asks the app instead, where a host delivers one at all; GNOME's
   * opens the menu instead.
