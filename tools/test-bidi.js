/*
 * The direction a banner reads in.
 *
 * A notification is one paragraph handed to a daemon that lays it out with
 * Pango, and Pango takes the paragraph's direction from its first strong
 * character. "Salah: <arabic>" therefore reads left to right, and an Arabic
 * sentence in a left-to-right paragraph wraps with its first line against the
 * right margin and every line after it against the left -- which is the report
 * this module exists to answer.
 *
 * One paragraph is meant literally, and half of what is checked below is that
 * nothing here ever writes a second one: the notification centre gives a
 * collapsed message a single line of body and offers the arrow that opens the
 * rest only when Pango cut something, so a banner broken into two paragraphs
 * shows the first and loses the message. See BREAKS in src/bidi.js.
 *
 * Nothing here needs Electron or a desktop: it is text in and text out.
